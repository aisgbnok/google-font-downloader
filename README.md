# Google Font Downloader

A simple python script that downloads fonts using Google's CSS API v2. It's not very elegant, but it serves its purpose
for what I need.

I built this for another personal project, and it also helped me refresh my python after being away from it for so long.

## Software For Public Good

***Don't use this for anything malicious or illegal!***

This software, as is, will not download restricted fonts. I can't stop an individual from changing the default behavior
of this software. I am not responsible for what other's choose to use this software for.

However, I strongly urge users to use this software for good, and not modify it for malicious purposes.
